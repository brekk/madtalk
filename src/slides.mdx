### A really cool language for really cool people

# An opinionated but entirely correct perspective

If you've written JavaScript before, it has some **cool parts**, but it has a lot of **sloppy, messy, gross** parts. 

If you've written TypeScript before, it tries to add _weak types_ to the aforementioned bucket of **sloppy gross** parts, and thus it is also mainly **sloppy and gross**, _but also_ it has the added benefit of a "type system" that needs help to be correct and you can't trust.

Notes: Microsoft's governance has accelerated it towards the eventual outcome of all MS owned projects: widely-accepted, broadly used mainly garbage.

# "What if we added Haskell types to JS?"

I posed this question (after a long discussion about the state of JS and the utility of functional programming, over several beers) to my buddy Arnaud Boeglin. We thought it would _probably_ be **pretty easy**, like a weekend project.

This was sometime in late 2020. üòÖ

# Madlib, Today `v0.20.0`

We've created a generic language which leverages HM types, is (currently) written in Haskell, can spit out JS for `node` or the browser, or `LLVM` / binary code. It comes with a considered set of tools and features out of the box:

<div class="features">

 - Language Server (and VSCode / Vim Plugins)
 - Automatic formatter with near zero-configuration
 - Built-in testing tools
 - Flexible installation patterns (which afford private dependencies)
 - Project generator
 - Project packaging / bundling
 - Automatic documentation generation
 - A powerful (yet dangerous) means of affording an escape-hatch - _The Fence_
 - Function composition
 - Automatic currying with placeholders
 - Typed holes
 - Polymorphic `interface` design
 - Algebraic Data Types (ADTs)
 - Monadic
 - Limited mutation

# What are Haskell / Hindley-Milner types?

Wikipedia says:

<div class="quote">

> A Hindley‚ÄìMilner (HM) type system is a classical type system for the lambda calculus with parametric polymorphism. It is also known as Damas‚ÄìMilner or Damas‚ÄìHindley‚ÄìMilner. [...] Among HM's more notable properties are its completeness and its ability to infer the most general type of a given program without programmer-supplied type annotations or other hints. Algorithm W is an efficient type inference method in practice and has been successfully applied on large code bases, although it has a high theoretical complexity.

# You talk pretty, but, do you know stuff?

Cool theories, **nerds**! But what does it look like and why should I care?

Let's start with the basics:

```
identity :: a -> a
identity = (x) => x
```

Here the type definition (the abstract representation of parameter and return types) is specified with the `::` and the following line gives the actual implementation. `a` is "any type, called 'a', which both the type of the input and the output" &mdash; if you call `identity` with a concrete type, say an integer like `100`, then the inference algorithm will validate that it satisfies the definition: `Integer -> Integer`


Notes: The type signature here demonstrates that parametric polyfoolery &mdash; You can "instantiate" it with a concrete type:

```
identity(100)
```

Internally the compiler validates that `Integer -> Integer` matches the abstract `a -> a` and _it does_!

---

# Let's see how it feels!

Because looking at code without syntax highlighting nor concrete outputs is for the birds!

---

# Primitives

```
string = "Hey there"
float = 1.34359
integer = 2
char = 'a'
boolean = true
```

---

# Less primitives

```
type Temperature = Celsius(Float) | Fahrenheit(Float) | Kelvin(Float)

fToC :: Temperature -> Temperature
fToC = (t) => where (t) {
  Fahrenheit(f) => Celsius((f - 32) * (5 / 9))
  _ => t
}

cToF :: Temperature -> Temperature
cToF = (t) => where (t) {
  Celsius(c) => Fahrenheit(c * (9/5) + 32)
  _ => t
}
```

# Built-in types

```
import List from "List"
import String from "String"
import Maybe from "Maybe"
import Either from "Either"
import Wish from "Wish"
```

---

# Types for a problem domain

Uhhhhhhh, a customer is just a stranger in disguise?

```
type User = Customer(Integer, String)
          | PotentialUser

findById :: Integer -> List User -> User
findById = (id, users) => List.filter(
  where {
    Customer(customerId, _) => customerId == id
    PotentialUser => false
  }
)(users)
```

üëÜüèº **This** isn't _quite right_, but let's try it out and see why!

# Questions?

There's a lot of stuff we've built, but we're excited to build more and find more of our community.
